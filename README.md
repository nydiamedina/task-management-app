# Coding Challenge: Task Management App

A REST API for a task management application using TypeScript, Express.js, TypeORM, and JWT authentication and following the model-repository-service architecture.

# Challenge Details

## The Challenge

You will be required to build a REST API for a simple task management application. The API should allow users to create, read, update, and delete tasks. Each task should have the following properties:

- Title (string)
- Description (string)
- Status (enum: "pending", "in progress", "done")

The API should also have a user authentication system using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs). Users should be able to sign up, log in, and log out.

## Requirements

1. The API should be built using Typescript, Node.js, and Express.js.
2. The database should be MySQL and the ORM should be TypeORM.
3. The code should be organized using a model-repository-service architecture.
4. The API should be Dockerized and the Docker configuration files should be included in the project.
5. Document the API with Swagger (Plus)
